       " 'METHODS\\tAsthmatic patients who were IgE sensitized to A fumigatus with a history of at least 2 severe exacerbations in the previous 12 months were treated for 3 months with 200 mg of voriconazole twice daily , followed by observation for 9 months , in a double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomized design .\\n',\n",
       " 'METHODS\\tPrimary outcomes were improvement in quality of life at the end of the treatment period and a reduction in the number of severe exacerbations over the 12 months of the study .\\n',\n",
